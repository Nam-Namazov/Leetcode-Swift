# Leetcode-Swift
Hi, my name is Namik, I'm beginner in iOS Development. I'm learning algorithms and for some reason I will sharing with solved problems here.
## Branches
#### Problems are categorized with branches by themes: 
* **Trees**:  *tree, binary tree, binary search tree, shortest path, minimum spanning tree*
* **Lists**: *graph, linked list, doubly-linked list, depth-first search, breadth-first search*
* **Others**: *recursion, queue, hash-table, stack, arrays, matrix*

#### By complexity:
- **easy**
- **medium**
- **hard**
