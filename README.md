# Leetcode-Swift
Hi, my name is Namik, I'm beginner in iOS Development. I'm learning algorithms and for some reason I will sharing with solved problems here.
## Branches
#### Problems are categorized with branches by themes: 
* **Trees**:  *tree, binary tree, binary search tree, shortest path, minimum spanning tree;*
* **Lists**: *graph, linked list, doubly-linked list, depth-first search, breadth-first search;*
* **Others**: *recursion, queue, hash-table, stack*

#### By complexity:
- **easy**
- **medium**
- **hard**

## Problems
#### Easy, Trees
1. [Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://github.com/Nam-Namazov/Leetcode-Swift/tree/trees/easy/Binary-Tree-Inorder-Traversal) 
2. [Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://github.com/Nam-Namazov/Leetcode-Swift/tree/trees/easy/MaximumDepth)
3. [Root Equals Sum of Children](https://github.com/Nam-Namazov/Leetcode-Swift/tree/trees/easy/RootEqualsSumofChildren)
